## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - TBA

### Added
- Kanban boards: browse cards by status column, view card detail with comments
  and operational history, create and edit cards, move cards through their
  workflow, act on many cards at once with accessible bulk actions, manage
  boards with shared active-board controls, preview and run the dispatcher from
  a toolbar sheet, and stay current through live updates with offline
  reconciliation.
- Settings toggles to hide unused parts of the app: session-list entries
  (Tasks, Kanban, Skills, Memory, Insights, Active Profile, Projects) and chat
  controls (Files button, Git actions). Everything stays visible by default.
- Opt-in response speed metrics.
- Public open-source release of the Hermex codebase.

### Fixed
- Interrupted backend streams now recover instead of stalling the response.
- Opening a transcript no longer jitters.
- Reopening a chat bounds the cached transcript instead of loading it all.
- Deep-linked sessions no longer lose the race to last-session restore.
- The file browser keeps the latest directory navigation.
- The session list refreshes after returning from a new chat.
